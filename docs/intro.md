# New research: Write more clearly and become a super communicator

How many times have you read an email or project brief and thought, “**Wait, what did that say?**” or worse, stopped reading partway through and moved on to the next task?

Ineffective written communication is all too common across teams and organizations, and its impact is substantial. More than a third of the workforce (loses 40-plus hours) [https://www.atlassian.com/blog/communication/how-to-avoid-emotional-overhead-at-work] each year to unclear written communication. That’s an entire week of work! Poor writing has the potential to create confusion and misalignment, slow decision-making, and (lead to costly misunderstandings).

## Getting Started

Get started by **creating a new site**.

Or **try Docusaurus immediately** with **[docusaurus.new](https://docusaurus.new)**.

### What you'll need

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 18.0 or above:
  - When installing Node.js, you are recommended to check all checkboxes related to dependencies.

## Generate a new site

Generate a new Docusaurus site using the **classic template**.

The classic template will automatically be added to your project after you run the command:

```bash
npm init docusaurus@latest my-website classic
```

You can type this command into Command Prompt, Powershell, Terminal, or any other integrated terminal of your code editor.

The command also installs all necessary dependencies you need to run Docusaurus.

## Start your site

Run the development server:

```bash
cd my-website
npm run start
```

The `cd` command changes the directory you're working with. In order to work with your newly created Docusaurus site, you'll need to navigate the terminal there.

The `npm run start` command builds your website locally and serves it through a development server, ready for you to view at http://localhost:3000/.

Open `docs/intro.md` (this page) and edit some lines: the site **reloads automatically** and displays your changes.
