# New research: Write more clearly and become a super communicator

How many times have you read an email or project brief and thought, “**Wait, what did that say?**” or worse, stopped reading partway through and moved on to the next task?

Ineffective written communication is all too common across teams and organizations, and its impact is substantial. More than a third of the workforce [loses 40-plus hours](https://www.atlassian.com/blog/communication/how-to-avoid-emotional-overhead-at-work) each year to unclear written communication. That’s an entire week of work! Poor writing has the potential to create confusion and misalignment, slow decision-making, and [lead to costly misunderstandings](https://hbr.org/2022/10/research-simple-writing-pays-off-literally?utm_campaign=hbr&utm_medium=social&utm_source=facebook).

## How to write more clearly with Smart Brevity

Smart Brevity helps cut through the noise. It makes communication clearer and more effective by teaching people how to “write less to say more.”

Let’s review the core principles of the Smart Brevity method:

Grab attention: Start with the most important detail. Summarize it in one strong sentence.

 1. **Keep it simple**: Use straightforward language and tight sentences.
 2. **Write like a human**: Avoid jargon. Write as if you’re speaking to a colleague over coffee.
 3. **Know your audience**: Write for your audience and address their specific needs.
 4. **Stay scannable**: Use short paragraphs, bolding, numbered lists (like this one!), and bullet points to make your message easy to scan.
 5. **Enough is enough**: Use as few words as possible to get your message across.
